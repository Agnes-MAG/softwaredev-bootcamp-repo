    <h3>Description</h3> 
    <p class="textdescription">Perfect pancakes are easier to make than you think.</br> This pancake recipe produces thick and all-around delicious pancakes with just a few ingredients.</br> Here's a delicious pancake recipe straight from my mother's kitchen.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>100g plain flour</li>
    <li> 2 large free range eggs</li>
    <li> 300ml milk</li>
    <li>Pinch salt</li>
    <li> Vegetable oil for frying</li>
    
</ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li> Place the flour and salt into a bowl and make a well (hole) in the centre. </li>
        <li>Crack the eggs into a jug with the milk and beat, then pour this slowly into the flour well.  </li>
        <li>  Draw the flour gradually into the middle whisking all the time until you have a smooth, pourable batter the consistency of single cream.</li>
        <li>Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes (if you have time), this allows the starch in the flour to swell and produces an even textured pancake.</li>
        <li>  Using kitchen paper, coat the inside of a heavy-based shallow frying pan with a small amount of the vegetable oil. </li>
        <li> Pour a small ladleful of the pancake mixture (about three tablespoons) into the pan, swirling the mixture around to form a thin layer that coats the base.  </li>
        <li> Cook for about 30 seconds until the pancake begins to set and is golden. Carefully, using a spatula or palette knife, flip the pancake over to cook the other side for a further 30 seconds until golden and crispy on the edges.</li>
        <li>Slide the pancake onto a plate and repeat with the remaining mixture, layering up the pancakes between baking paper. </li> 
        <li> Pile high with your chosen sweet or savoury toppings and enjoy.</li>
